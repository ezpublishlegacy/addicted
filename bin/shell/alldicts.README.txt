ALLDICTS SUITE
==============

Aren't you getting tired of managing dicts 
in 10 languages in 10 extensions ? Aren't
you worn out by managing translations on
a live site, while the stuff on a dev server
is getting out of sync ? Isn't it a hell of a job
to package all these changes up and send it 
out to 10 translators ?

So this suite is for you. You should read
and tweek the central config file,
alldicts.cfg. After that, you can run any
of these scripts. On Linux or Mac, that is.

alldicts.sh
	runs all the scripts below verbose, 
	with prompts in between. can't harm,
	you can say 'no' anywhere.

alldicts-download.sh
	downloads all dictionaries in all languages
	in share/translations and extensions 
	from a remote server using scp, if needed.

alldicts-ezlupdate.sh
	runs ezlupdate on all dicts in all languages
	on all extensions and a couple (or all) designs

alldicts-autofill.sh
alldicts-autofill.xslt
	together, fill out empty translations with
	the value of the comment, for one specified
	locale. very obscure. optional.
	
alldicts-report.sh
	writes a report for every locale 
	
alldicts-package.sh
	copies the dict files from all over the 
	place into a single dir, for you to zip
	and send of for translation.
	
alldicts.README.txt
	DOH - You're reading it.

Have fun,
